# Electric-Equilibrium-Potential-Simulation-using-Jacobi-Relaxation

Simulates electric equilibrium potential in a region of space that does not contain any electric charge, using Jacobi relaxation method, in 2D and 3D.

In this script, we solve a discretized Laplace equation using Jacobi relaxation algorithm and obtain an approximation of the solution depending on user defined number of iterations "n".

The program outputs:
- A gradient graph of the electrical potential between two metal plates in 2D.
- 3D gradient graph of the electrical potential of a box with user defined position of volume slices.
- Visualization of the electric field vectors direction (both in 3D and 2D simulations).
